In the past people thought of illness as caused by \"bad air\" or evil spirits. But in the 1800s Doctors started looking more at anatomy, doing autopsies and started making arguments based on data. Dr Semmelweis suspected that something was going wrong with the procedures at Vienna General Hospital. Semmelweis wanted to figure out why so many women in maternity wards were dying from childbed fever (i.e., [puerperal fever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postpartum_infections)).\n","\n","<img src=https://i.imgur.com/lSyNUwR.png width=700>\n","\n","Today you will become Dr Semmelweis.
