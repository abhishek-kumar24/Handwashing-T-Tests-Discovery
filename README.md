## Analyzed data collected from Patients (1841 to 1849) ðŸ”¥

> In the past, people didn't know about bacteria, germs, or viruses. People illness was caused by "bad air" or evil spirits. But in the 1800s Doctors started looking more at anatomy, doing autopsies and making arguments based on data. 

> Dr Semmelweis suspected that something was going wrong with the procedures at Vienna General Hospital. Dr Semmelweis wanted to figure out why so many women in maternity wards were dying from childbed fever (i.e., puerperal fever). So, Now we'll  analyse the same data collected from 1841 to 1849. (More Detail will be in Project)


## What I've learned:


âœ… Make a compelling argument using data

âœ… Superimpose histograms to show differences in distributions

âœ… Use a Kernel Density Estimate (KDE)Â to show a graphic estimate of a distribution.

âœ… Use scipy and test for statistical significance by looking at p-values.

âœ… Highlight different parts of a time series chart in Matplotib.

âœ… Add and configure a Legend in Matplotlib.

âœ… Use NumPy's .where()Â function to process elements depending on a condition.
